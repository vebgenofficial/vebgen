## 💡 The Idea

**In one sentence, what is your feature request?**
<!-- e.g., "Add support for the FastAPI framework" or "Implement a circuit breaker for error recovery" -->


## 🎯 The Problem

**What problem does this feature solve? Why is it necessary?**
<!-- 
Describe the pain point you're experiencing. The more detail, the better.
Good: "When the agent fails to apply a patch, I have to manually fix the code, which breaks the autonomous workflow."
Bad: "Patching is broken."
-->


## 🚀 The Solution

**How do you envision this feature working?**
<!-- 
Describe your ideal implementation. Be as specific as possible.
Consider backend logic, UI changes, and user interactions.
-->


**What would be a good example of its usage?**
```text
Show how a user would interact with this feature.
This could be a sample command, a UI mockup description, or a code snippet.
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

**How will we know this feature is successful?**
<!-- 
What are the key outcomes? How can we test that it's working correctly?
e.g., "1. The agent can successfully generate a complete FastAPI project from a prompt."
e.g., "2. A new 'Retry with different model' button appears in the UI on task failure."
-->


## 🔄 Alternatives

**Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?**
<!-- What other solutions did you consider? Why is your proposed solution better? Mention any trade-offs. -->
